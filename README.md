# Bookmarklet-console

This is a bookmarklet console. Useful for cases (such as on school computers) where you cannot access the regular console, it has many of the functions of the normal console.

To install it:

- Copy the code
- Click the little star icon at the right end of your search bar to make a bookmark
- Click "more"
- Type "Console" in the "Name" box
- Paste the code into the "URL" space
- Click "save"
- Click the bookmark when in a webpage (yes, any webpage, including GeoFS) to run it.

To use it (since some people apparently don't know how to copy and paste):

- Copy any code that you want to run
- Click the icon that appears in the bottom right of your screen to open the console
- Click the bar at the bottom
- Right-click and select "paste" to put the code in the box
- Click "execute"
- Click the icon in the bottom right again to close the console.
